# PicoScope 9000 Series MATLAB Examples

picosdk-ps9000-matlab-examples is a set of examples demonstrating how to control the PicoScope® 9200 and PicoScope 9300 Series PC Sampling Oscilloscopes using ActiveX with MATLAB®. 

The examples consist of MATLAB code which will display a GUI when run. A brief guide is included with each example. 

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

* [MATLAB](https://uk.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) for Microsoft Windows (32- or 64-bit).
* PicoScope 9200 or PicoSample software (see [Installing software](https://github.com/picotech/picosdk-ps9000-matlab-examples/#installing-software))

**Notes:**

* MATLAB 2015b is recommended for 32-bit versions of MATLAB on Microsoft Windows operating systems.

### Supported models

#### PicoScope 9200

* PicoScope 9201A 
* PicoScope 9211A 
* PicoScope 9221A 
* PicoScope 9231A

#### PicoScope 9300

* PicoScope 9301 
* PicoScope 9302 
* PicoScope 9311 
* PicoScope 9312 
* PicoScope 9321 
* PicoScope 9341

### Installing the examples

We recommend using the [Add-Ons Explorer](https://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_env/get-add-ons.html) in MATLAB in order to install these files and obtain updates.

If your version of MATLAB does not have the Add-Ons Explorer, download the zip file from the [MATLAB Central File Exchange page](https://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/52658-picoscope-9000-series-matlab-examples)
 and add the root and sub-folders to the MATLAB path.

### Installing software

* Download the PicoScope9200 software for PicoScope 9200 Series models or PicoSample software for PicoScope 9300 Series models from our [Downloads page](https://www.picotech.com/downloads).

### Programmer's Guides

You can download Programmer's Guides providing a description of the API functions for the relevant PicoScope from our [website](https://www.picotech.com/library/documentation).
